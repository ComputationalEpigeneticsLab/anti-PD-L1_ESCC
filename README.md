Abstract
PD-L1 blockade offers new therapeutic options for esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC), however the underlying mechanisms and associated biomarkers that determine treatment response remain unclear. Here, we characterize the cellular dynamics following PD-L1 blockade via analyzing the single-cell transcriptomes of 210,978 cells and spatial transcriptomes of 20 tissue sections. We identify coordinated cellular programs composed of CXCL13+ CD8+ exhausted T (Tex) cells, TNFRSF9+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), atypical memory B cells (AtM) and APOE+ macrophages, which coordinate the responses to PD-L1 blockade at baseline. In post-treatment non-responder ESCCs, the cellular programs exhibit immunosuppressive phenotype, leading to the failure of therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, we reveal that LAG3 serves as a potential target and can potentiate the response via perturbation of the coordinated cellular programs. Overall, our findings unravel the coordinated cellular programs associated with treatment response, providing insights for prioritizing individualized immunotherapy therapeutic strategies in ESCC.
